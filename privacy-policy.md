# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** {{ site.time | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}

Peak Form (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is a minimal workout app. This policy explains what information the app processes and how it is handled.

> **Short version:** The app is designed to work **on your device**. We do **not** collect, store, or sell your personal information on our servers. If you later enable optional cloud features or analytics, this page will be updated and you will see an in‑app disclosure.

---

## Scope

This policy covers the Peak Form mobile application available on the Google Play Store and any pages hosted at this website for informational purposes (e.g., this policy).

## Data We Process

### On‑device data (not sent to us)
The app allows you to create and manage fitness information on your device, such as:
- Workout sessions and sets
- Timers and rest intervals
- Streak counters and achievements
- Nutrition logs or meal notes (if you use those features)

This information is stored locally on your device using standard operating‑system storage (for example, app‑private storage such as SharedPreferences or an on‑device database). We do not receive this data.

### Information we **do not** collect by default
- No account registration is required
- No name, email, or contact information
- No precise location or background location
- No health data is transmitted to us
- No advertising identifiers are used
- No third‑party advertising SDKs

> If you use external features (e.g., email us for support), your email sender will process that message under its own terms.

<!--
## Optional features (only if introduced in a future update)

We may add optional features later. If we do, we will request consent and update this policy before they go live:

- **Cloud backup or sync.** If enabled, selected app data would be transmitted to a cloud provider to let you restore or synchronize across devices. We would limit storage to what’s necessary for the feature, encrypt data in transit, and delete upon your request.
- **Crash reports or analytics.** If enabled, the app may send crash logs and anonymous usage metrics to help improve stability and performance. These would not include your workout content. You can opt out in Settings.
- **Notifications.** If enabled, we may ask permission to send local notifications for reminders or timers.
-->

## Permissions

The app may request certain operating‑system permissions to function, such as:
- **Notifications** for reminders and timers
- **Foreground service** for long‑running timers
- **Vibration** for haptic feedback

The app does **not** request sensitive permissions like camera, microphone, contacts, or precise location. If this changes in the future, you will see a permission prompt and this page will be updated.

## How We Use Information

- Provide core app features on your device
- Maintain and improve the app (e.g., fixing bugs if optional crash reports are enabled)
- Communicate with you **only** if you contact us first (e.g., support email)

We do **not** sell your personal information. We do **not** use targeted advertising.

## Data Sharing

We do not share your personal information with third parties.<!-- If we add optional cloud backup, a trusted infrastructure provider may process the data as our processor solely to provide that service. -->

## Data Retention and Deletion

- **On‑device data** remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the app.
<!-- - If optional cloud backup becomes available and you enable it, we will retain that data until you delete it in‑app or email us to request deletion. -->
- You can clear the app’s local data at any time <!-- via the app’s Settings (if provided) or -->via your device’s system settings for the app.

## Security

We use reasonable technical and organizational measures appropriate to the risk. No method of transmission or storage is perfectly secure, but we aim to minimize the amount of personal information we process by keeping data on‑device.

## Children’s Privacy

Peak Form is not directed to children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe a child provided us information, contact us so we can delete it.

## International Users

We do not operate servers for this app by default. If we later introduce cloud features, your information may be processed in the country where our processor operates. We will only transfer data in compliance with applicable law.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. We will post the updated version here and update the effective date.

## Contact Us

If you have questions about this policy<!-- or wish to request deletion of any cloud‑stored data (if applicable)-->, contact:

**Email:** imshaheer01@gmail.com  
**Developer:** Peak Form

## Google Play Data Safety summary (for your reference)

If the app remains on‑device only and you do not use analytics or cloud features:
- **Data collection:** No data collected
- **Data sharing:** No data shared with third parties
- **Data encryption:** Data is encrypted in transit (N/A for purely on‑device); local storage is device‑level
- **Data deletion:** Users can delete data by clearing it in Settings or uninstalling the app

<!--If you later add crash reporting, analytics, or cloud backup, you must revise the above and disclose the relevant categories in Play Console.-->
